I've been juggling around a few ideas for a new project and I've decided to pursue looking at bEV charging infrastructure. California is a leader in automobile electrification and should have ample information I can parse to achieve my goals. At the end of this project I will create an interactive map where I estimate the cost of electricity and estimate the cost of an ev charging station. First I want to create a way to determine costs based on location, the utility provider, and time of day. Maybe an interactive map of California where I could drop a pin in a location and calculate the estimated cost of electricity for that location. Then I need to look into how charging stations operate. Some stations charge a flat fee while others charge based on time of day, location, and time spent charging. First thing's first. I'll take a look at the California Energy Commission website to see if I can get information regarding energy generation. I may be able to get some pricing data from PG&E but California ISO seems like a better bet as they provide real time energy pricing information. So starts another project!
