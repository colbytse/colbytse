I tried a few ways to pull the information I needed from CAISO but ended up with a few snags. Their free data pull will vary with time of day and I suspect the amount of information I can pull/bandwith I can use is dependent on the traffic they're getting at the time. Which made for some varying time outs on my end and would leave a wide variance in when and how much I could pull. 

I've decided to shelve this project for now and start a [new project](https://github.com/colbytse/audio-readme) focused on something else. I like many have lost loved ones and thought I may be able to help others find some comfort or closure. My intent is to create an audio ML model that can play back audio from a few small clips from the person and match their voice. If for no other reason than to hear those who have passed say "I love you" one last time. I've begun my research and will assess the viability of this endeavor.
