I've no luck getting an API key from CAISO, so I'll have to rethink my approach here. The amount of data I can access will be incredibly limited and I may not be able to gather the amount I need within a reasonable time frame. I've thought of a couple other possible projects to pursue instead. I'm thinking of web based machine learning or a project in a new language like Java or both!
