Testing continues as I fiddle with my about me page and incorporating images. I've come across a hiccup when trying to split a body of text and inserting an image within. Trouble shooting continues as I try to figure out what I've done and how to fix it. There's now a placeholder image in About Me mostly as a container to hold the code I need to place an image there. I'm learning a little bit every day!
