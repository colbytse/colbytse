Created two image classification models for two tasks: A binary model to parse whether or not a tumor exists within a given image and a multi-class model to identify/classify what type of tumor is present. Using these models, I built a Streamlit application to pass a given image through both models and determine if there is a cause for concern. Note this is not a diagnostic tool and intended for informational use only.

Managed a team of data scientists in a deep dive EDA of data taken from *The China Study*. Our goal was to discover any correlations between lifestyle choices and varying causes of death. By virtue of looking at feature importances as measured in linear regression models, we discover some correlations between various lifestyle factors and choices to causes of death.

Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression, I created an NLP model and subsequent Streamlit application to tell me which subreddit I should post my content to.
