    <p>I'm an Analytical Chemist turned Data Scientist. My past experience had me handling increasingly larger data sets from drug discovery, manufacturing, high throughput fermentation samples, and equally increasingly difficult analysis of this data. My journey as an Analytical Chemist has all roads pointed to utilizing newer technologies to accommodate the increasing complexity of my work so it only made sense to educate myself as a Data Scientist.</p>

    <p> I used to use Excel or Google Sheets to handle egregiously large data sets for the platforms and perform manual calculations. Now I'm significantly better equipped to handle various analyses utilizing Python, SQL, machine learning, regression models, natural language processing and so much more. I'm a Scientist through and through and I'll never stop learning be it in life or data sciences.</p>
