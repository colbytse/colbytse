    <p>I'm based in California but have spent most of my life in the Bay Area. Since 2015 I've been in all manner of industries leveraging my expertise in analytical chemistry. I've been a QC Chemist, QA Specialist, R&D scientist, team leader, supervisor and fulfilled many more duties beyond my titles. I've had my hands in manufacturing, drug testing, biological research , materials science and have been all around the Bay Area learning and growing. As my career advanced so did technology and the complexity of R&D in life sciences, which led me down the path of a data scientist. I learned skills one may normally associate with a programmer or software engineer. Querying SQL databases and writing basic scripts. With all roads leading me to becoming a data scientist that is where I stand today. I've added Python, machine learning, regression modeling, natural language processing, and a plethora of other skills to become a better scientist. </p>
